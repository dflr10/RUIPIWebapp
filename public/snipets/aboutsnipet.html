        <h2>How RUIPI is conceived?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">This project was born at the beginning of 2020, when the students of the training program
            in analysis and development of information systems of the Sena espv and dflr after carrying out
            a scan of information and a diagnosis for the creation of a software tailored to
            the problems found in the IPS Gonnawindua Ette Ennaka.</p>

    <h2>Why RUIPI?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The Unique Registry for the Identification of Indigenous Patients is created in response to the
        problem
        of the lack of a characterization of indigenous communities, specifically the
        Kogui, Wiwa and Arahuaca communities, who, by different interpretations, conceptions and
        community and identity perspectives, are reticent to the concept of identification
        under which the Colombian state is protected. In addition to this contingency of a sociicultural type
        there is the problem of the coverage that indigenous populations have regarding access
        to essential goods, among which is the registration of their persons in the
        registry offices and the scant work carried out by government entities to counteract the
        existing gap.

        For this reason, RUIPI seeks, without wanting to replace the identity document issued by the registry
        solve in an efficient way the problem of lack of characterization.
        Using the use of biometric recognition technologies, and with the implementation of
        a software that stores and allows the modification of user and patient profiles,
        as well as the access and modification of the clinical history and the visualization of the programs
        prevention and early detection of diseases, RUIPI seeks to improve the processes related to
        with patient care, as well as medical experience with them.</p>
